Exercise 1:

Create a table of 10 elements, which will consist of complex numbers and then calculate its phase using the angle and phase functions, as well as using the formulas as they were taught in the lesson for calculating the phase of a complex number. Next, interpret the results of the different approaches. Are the results expected?


Exercise 2:

Display the discrete delta function in the interval [-6,6] and in the same graph (using the hold on command) approach the delta function using the sinc function.

Exercise 3:

In two horizontal subdivisions of the same chart window (using the subplot command) display the following:
• 1st subdivision: Display the sine function in the interval [-2π, 2π], as well as the compression and extension of the signal by a factor a equal to 2. Simultaneous display of signals can be done using the hold on command.
• 2nd subdivision: Display the cosine function in the interval [-2π, 2π], as well as its time delay by π / 4. Similarly, the hold on command can be used.
